HTTP Requests Example
This is a simple Python application that demonstrates making HTTP requests to retrieve and display images. The application uses the Tkinter library for the GUI and makes use of the requests library to fetch images from various APIs.

Prerequisites
Python installed (version 3.x recommended)
Setup and Configuration
Clone the Repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
cd your-repo
Install Dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Application:
python main.py
Application Logic:
The main window displays three buttons: "CAT," "DOG," and "FOX."
Each button triggers an HTTP request to a different API that provides random images of cats, dogs, and foxes.
The "Exit" button closes the application.
Error Handling
If an error occurs during the HTTP request or image processing, an error message is displayed using Tkinter's messagebox.
